## Contributing Code
The preferred workflow for contributing is to clone the main repository on GitHub and develop on a branch. 

Steps:
- Clone the repo from your GitHub account to your local disk:
$ git clone https://github.com/NeuroDataDesign/savanna.git
- Create a feature branch to hold your development changes:
$ git checkout -b my-feature
- Develop the feature on your feature branch. Add changed files using git add and then git commit files:
$ git add modified_files
$ git commit
to record your changes in Git, push the changes to your branch with:
$ git pull origin master
$ git push origin my-feature

## Pull Request Checklist
We recommended that your contribution complies with the following rules before you submit a pull request:

Give your pull request a helpful title that summarises what your contribution does. In some cases Fix <ISSUE TITLE> is enough. Fix #<ISSUE NUMBER> is not enough.

All public methods should have informative docstrings with sample usage presented as doctests when appropriate.

At least one paragraph of narrative documentation with links to references in the literature (with PDF links when possible) and the example.

All functions and classes must have unit tests. These should include, at the very least, type checking and ensuring correct computation/outputs.

Ensure all tests are passing locally using pytest. Install the necessary packages by:

$ pip install pytest pytest-cov
then run

$ pytest
or you can run pytest on a single test file by

$ pytest path/to/test.py
Run an autoformatter. We use black and would like for you to format all files using black. You can run the following lines to format your files.

$ pip install black
$ black path/to/module.py
